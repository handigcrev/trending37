                More than 380,000 gallons of oil spilled from the keystone pipeline in north dakota this week, one of the largest onshore crude spills in the past decade. The $5.2 billion pipeline was activated in 2010 as part of a system that also is to include the proposed $8 billion keystone xl pipeline, which is designed to transport the oil from canada down to the gulf coast. The keystone xl pipeline would then connect to existing pipelines and transport oil to refineries along the gulf coast. The keystone xl pipeline is a proposed extension of the keystone pipeline system that will transport oil from canada to refineries in the united states. All it does is increase the capacity of the existing keystone pipeline system, which has already transported over 550 million barrels of canadian heavy. Keystone xl is basically just another pipeline; South dakota&#039;s keystone pipeline, the controversial structure whose extension triggered the standing rock protests ( see photos ), has leaked 200,000 gallons of oil, or about 5,000 barrels.

More than 380,000 gallons of oil spilled from the keystone pipeline in north dakota this week, one of the largest onshore crude spills in the past decade. Tc energy is also seeking to build the keystone xl pipeline that would begin in hardisty, alberta, and go to steele city, nebraska. All it does is increase the capacity of the existing keystone pipeline system, which has already transported over 550 million barrels of canadian heavy. The leak comes just days before nebraska officials announce a decision on whether the proposed keystone xl pipeline, a sister project, can move forward. A little longer and larger than most, but not unusually so, and it goes nowhere pipelines don&#039;t already go. A spill would be devastating to the farms, ranches, and communities that depend on these crucial ecosystems. Keystone pipeline spills over 380,000 gallons in north dakota.

Transcanada corp&#039;s existing keystone pipeline has leaked substantially more oil, and more often the canadian company is now seeking to expand the pipeline system linking alberta&#039;s oil fields to u.s. The keystone xl pipeline extension, proposed by energy infrastructure company transcanada in 2008, was designed to transport the planet&#039;s dirtiest fossil fuel to market, fast. The keystone xl pipeline would then connect to existing pipelines and transport oil to refineries along the gulf coast. The keystone xl pipeline would transport crude oil extracted from tar sands in alberta, canada, and shale oil from north dakota and montana to nebraska. Keystone xl pipeline creates a boost for communities by providing job opportunities to workers in key areas of canada and the united states. The keystone xl pipeline would carry canadian tar sand oil 875 miles from morgan, montana to steele city, nebraska. This plan outlines the procedures for prevention, containment, and control of potential spills during project construction and reclamation. Spills were among the major concerns listed by protestors of the pipeline&#039;s controversial xl extension. It would mirror an operational pipe, also called keystone, but would take a more direct route, boosting the flow of oil from canada. Although the keystone xl project has generated plenty of attention over the past few years, there is already a keystone pipeline. Refineries with its proposed keystone xl project, which has u.s. But tar sand pipeline spills are worse. The literature so far has focused on the consequences of crashes and spills, which is important.
